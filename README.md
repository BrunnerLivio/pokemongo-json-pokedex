This program transforms the data from the Pokemon GO master files
to a better readable & processable JSON file.

![Philosophy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrunnerLivio/pokemongo-json-pokedex/master/.github/philosophy.png)

## Purpose

As a developer it can be in certain situation quite annoying depend on
the raw [GAME MASTER](https://github.com/pokemongo-dev-contrib/pokemongo-game-master) files.
Not only are some informations quite hidden
and must be parsed, the structure of the GAME MASTER files can change
after every version. **pokemongo-json-pokedex** parses the GAME
MASTER data and tries to maintain the same structure, even when the
structure of the source files changed completely.

## Getting Started

You can get the latest version by executing the following command in your shell.
Make sure you have `wget` installed

```bash

git clone https://github.com/pokemongo-dev-contrib/pokemongo-json-pokedex.git

# Go to the assets
cd pokemongo-json-pokedex/output
ls
# âžœ avatar-customization.json  item.json  locales  move.json  pokemon.json  type.json

```

or you can use it with npm using `npm install pokemongo-json-pokedex`

```JavaScript

const pokemon = require('pokemongo-json-pokedex/output/pokemon.json');
